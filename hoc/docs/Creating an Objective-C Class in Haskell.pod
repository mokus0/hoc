=head2 Creating an Objective-C Class in Haskell

As well as being able to use Objective-C classes in Haskell, HOC
also enables you to I<create> an Objective-C class in Haskell:
you can subclass an existing Objective-C class, declare instance
variables and methods in a class, and write code for it all in
Haskell.  You can even make your class the owner of an Interface
Builder F<.nib> file, and Interface Builder's outlets and actions
can call methods in your class.


=head3 Programming Examples

If you're the type of person who learns best by following
examples rather than reading documentation, HOC comes with two
sample programs in the F<Samples/> directory of the HOC source
code distribution:

=over

=item * Editor:

A simple text editor, which loads and saves files with a F<.hs>
extension.  There are no fancy features in the editor, but it is
a full document-based application.  The C<HaskellDocument> class
included with this sample application is a subclass of
C<NSDocument>, and implements methods used by a document-based
application, such as C<readFromFileOfType:> and
C<windowControllerDidLoadNib:>.

=item * Browser:

A simple class browser.  It uses Objective-C's reflection
capabilities to query the I<Foundation> and I<AppKit> frameworks,
and displays all the Objective-C method names found, the
corresponding Haskell function name, the Haskell type, and which
class the method is defined in.  (Note that this program might
take a while to start up and will bounce in the dock for a while,
because it's reading all the method names during startup.)

=head3 The Objective-C Class Creation Haskell API

So, how do you create an Objective-C class in Haskell?  The two
main HOC functions you will require are C<declareClass> and
C<exportClass>.  Note that these functions are I<Template
Haskell> (TH) functions, so you'll need to use Template Haskell's
special C<$(...)> syntax to use them.  (If you don't know what
Template Haskell is, see the next section which gives a very
quick overview about what it is.)

=for comment XXX: Insert hyperlink to next section

=head4 The C<declareClass> function

The C<declareClass> function is somewhat analgagous to writing
the type signature for a function: in the same way that a type
signature tells the compiler that you intend to write the body of
a function later in the code, C<declareClass> tells HOC that you
intend to define a class later in your code.

The type of C<declareClass> is
C<< String -> String -> Q [Dec] >>.
Its first argument is the name of the class that you wish to
write in Haskell, and the second argument is the name of an
existing Objective-C class that you want to subclass (such as
I<NSObject> or I<NSDocument>).

For example,

  $(declareClass "MyDocument" "NSDocument")

declares a new class named I<MyDocument> which is a subclass of
I<NSDocument>.  (Imaginative, huh?)

=for comment XXX: Maybe turn above into a type signature

You must declare an existing class to subclass: you cannot
currently create a new class which sits at the root of an object
hierarchy (such as I<NSObject> or I<NSProxy>).

=for comment XXX: Wolfgang -- is the above correct?

=head4 The C<exportClass> function

After using the C<declareClass> Template Haskell function to
declare a new Objective-C class, you can then I<export> the
actual definition of the class with the C<exportClass> function.
Here's the type of C<exportClass>, which gives a very brief
overview of how to use it:

  :: String         -- ^ Name of the class you're exporting,
                    --   e.g. "MyDocument" 
  -> String         -- ^ A prefix for function names which are
		    --   methods belonging to this class,
		    --   e.g. "md_"
  -> [ClassMember]  -- ^ A list of class members (see below for
                    --   example)
  -> Q [Dec]        -- ^ Code which produces a Haskell declaration,
		    --   which you can splice in with Template
		    --   Haskell's $(...) syntax

Here are the parameters you need to supply to C<exportClass> in
a bit more detail:

=over

=item * C<String>

The name of the class you're exporting (which must match the name
of a class you've declared previously with C<declareClass>),

=item * C<String>

A I<methods prefix> (string), which tells HOC what functions in
the current Haskell source file are methods belonging to the
exported class.  HOC scans each function name in your Haskell
source file: every function name which begins with the methods
prefix you specify will be exported as a (class or instance)
method, belonging to the exported class.

For instance, if you declare and export a I<MyDocument> class,
a sensible methods prefix could be C<md_>.  Then, any function
names which begins with C<md_> will be treated as a method for
that I<MyDocument> class.  For example, C<md_windowNibName> or
C<md_windowControllerDidLoadNib> would be methods of
I<MyDocument> (and thus expected to have the proper type
signature for such a method), but C<wibble> would not be.

=item * C<[ClassMember]>

This argument specifies what members the class should have, i.e.
instance methods, class methods, instance variables, and outlets.
The C<ClassMember> data structure is defined as:

  data ClassMember = InstanceMethod SelectorInfo
                   | ClassMethod SelectorInfo
                   | Outlet String TypeQ
                   | InstanceVariable String TypeQ ExpQ

Hopefully the type information will inform you about what
arguments you need to provide to each of the data contructors to
produce a C<ClassMember>.  (Refer to the documentation about
C<ClassMember>s if you need more help with them.)

=for comment XXX: document & provide link to ClassMember

Here's an example of what this particular argument might look
like (taken directly from the
F<Samples/Editor/HaskellDocument.hs> file in the HOC source
distribution):

  [ Outlet "textView" [t| NSTextView () |]
  , InstanceVariable "text" [t| Maybe (NSString ()) |] [| Nothing |]
  , InstanceMethod info_windowNibName
  , InstanceMethod info_writeToFileOfType
  , InstanceMethod info_readFromFileOfType
  , InstanceMethod info_windowControllerDidLoadNib
  ]

=back

The type of output of C<exportClass> is C<Q [Dec]>, which is code
that produces a Haskell declaration, which you need to use within
Template Haskell's C<$(...)> context.

=head4 Using C<declareClass> and C<exportClass>

Putting it all together, here's a small example of how you might
write a I<HaskellDocument> class (which subclasses I<NSDocument>)
in Haskell:

  import HOC

  $(declareClass "HaskellDocument" "NSDocument")

  $(exportClass "HaskellDocument" "hd_" [
	  Outlet "textView" [t| NSTextView () |],
	  InstanceVariable "text" [t| Maybe (NSString ()) |] [| Nothing |],
	  InstanceMethod info_windowNibName,
	  InstanceMethod info_writeToFileOfType,
	  InstanceMethod info_readFromFileOfType,
	  InstanceMethod info_windowControllerDidLoadNib
      ])
