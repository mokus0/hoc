<h1>About</h1>

<p>HOC is a <strong>H</strong>askell to
<strong>O</strong>bjective-<strong>C</strong> binding.  In a nutshell, it
enables you to use Objective-C objects and frameworks from Haskell, and also
enables you to write Objective-C objects in Haskell.</p>

<p>The Haskell interfaces produced by HOC are:</p>

<ul> 

  <li><strong>Typed</strong>: Take advantage of Haskell's sound type inference
  to help you develop robust, correct Cocoa/GNUstep applications on your first
  compile.</li> 

  <li><strong>Automatically Generated</strong>: HOC comes with an <em>interface
  generator</em> to generate Haskell bindings to Objective-C's objects; use it
even with your own custom Objective-C frameworks!</li>

  <li><strong>Haskell-Friendly</strong>: We make heavy use of key Haskell
  features such as type classes and partial application, to ensure that the HOC
  API is as 'Haskell-like' as possible.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can write <a href="screenshots.html">full-blown applications</a> in HOC
and use all of the Foundation, AppKit and Cocoa frameworks' classes (including
all of the AppKit's GUI objects), combining Objective-C tools such as Mac OS
X's advanced <a
  href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/interfacebuilder/">Interface
  Builder</a> to build the GUI graphically while writing controllers for the
GUI in Haskell.  You can even mix and match custom objects written in
Objective-C with objects written in Haskell, depending on which language you
find more suitable for the task.
